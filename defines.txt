# defines (originally what-defs)                            30 Nov 2003
# version:
            v="4.1.1"
#
# usage:  defines [-d] [-i] [cc-name [cc-opts]]
#
# Print names and values of predefined cpp macros, plus sizes of basic
# C variable types.  By default check standard "cc", but GNU C or another
# compiler may be checked instead by giving "gcc" (or whatever) as an
# argument (name only, no path).  If the first argument is the compiler
# name, up to four additional arguments may be included as options for
# the compiler to alter the preprocessor behavior.  Note that poking
# through the preprocessor(s) may take a while (e.g., Cray scpp is 8MB)
# and that cc on at least some systems (e.g., SCO) is executable but not
# world-readable.  This version now fails gracefully if all compiler com-
# ponents are unreadable by the user (thanks to James Birdsall for the
# suggestion).
#
# With the -i option, defines will also check strings found in system header
# files, at least some of which are likely to be predefined (Dan Quinlan
# idea).  This can be very slow, however, and might cause overflows on some
# systems.
#
# The -d option turns on debugging output; it shows what binaries are being
# searched, which may indicate the source of the problem if some of the
# standard macros aren't found ("... should already be listed above").
#
# defines uses the following more-or-less standard Unix utilities:
#
#    /bin/sh [echo, test]  date  uname  sed  strings  tr  sort  rm  cat
#
# plus, of course, the C preprocessor and compiler.  "date" and "uname"
# are used only for identifying info and may be omitted (Convex doesn't
# have the latter, for example).
#
# Written by Robert Skinner, Skip Montanaro, Greg Roelofs, John Bush,
# Kjetil Jørgensen and others; original author unknown.  Versions 2.0 through
# 3.18 maintained by GRR (newt at pobox.com).
#
# Versions 4.0 and later are maintained by Bjørn Reese (breese at
# users.sourceforge.net) and distributed via http://predef.sourceforge.net/ .
#
# Changelog:
#   4.0  20030622  Bjorn Reese
#     * Added sizes of pointer-to-object and pointer-to-function.
#
#   4.1  20030629  Bjorn Reese
#     * Using CHAR_BIT to calculate sizes.
#
#   4.1.1  20031130  Greg Roelofs
#     * Added some GCC-specific "long long" macros (note:  uses defined(),
#       not ifdef--break into four-level nested block to support K&R compilers)
#
#   4.1.2  20100821  Uffe Jakobsen
#     * Added LC_ALL export to handle a problem with illegal byte sequences in
#       tr on Darwin.

# parse options, if any (change "if" to "while" if add more options)
